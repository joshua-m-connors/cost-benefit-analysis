cost-benefit-analysis

This is R code designed to perform cost-benefit analysis where there is a probability distribution of success and failure associated with a given decsion.

When the decision succeeds or fails there is then a distribution of occurances and gains or losses.

The model calculates each distribution and then provides a combined result distribution that can be used in making the decision.
